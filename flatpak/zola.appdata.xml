      Zola comes as a single executable with Sass compilation, syntax highlighting, table of contents and many other features 
      that traditionally require setting up a dev environment adding some JavaScript libraries to your site.
    </p>
    <p>
      The average site will be generated in less than a second, including Sass compilation and syntax highlighting.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zola renders your whole site as static files, making it trivial to handle any kind of traffic you will throw at it at no 
      cost without having to worry about managing a server or a database.
    </p>
    <p>
      From the CLI to the template engine, everything is designed to be intuitive. Don't take my word for it though, look at the
      documentation and see for yourself.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zola gets out of your way so you can focus on your content, be it a blog, a knowledge base, a landing page or a combination 
      of them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Zola comes with shortcodes and internal links to make it easier to write your content.
